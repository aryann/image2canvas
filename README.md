image2canvas
===============

A small utility that generates grayscale JavaScript canvas code for an
image. See the comment at the top of image2canvas.py for more details.

For an example, see example.html which is the code generated for
example.jpg. (github may omit parts of example.html because it's too
big, so you may have to view the "Raw" version of the file.)
